# About casket-ssg

casket-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Haskell.

## Why Haskell?

Haskell's strong type system catches errors at compile time, ensuring reliable transformations from markdown to HTML. Its lazy evaluation and powerful abstractions like monads make handling file I/O elegant. Libraries like Pandoc (written in Haskell) demonstrate the language's natural fit for document processing.
