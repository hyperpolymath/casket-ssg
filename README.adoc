**The definitive Haskell static site generator.**

== Overview

casket-ssg is a pure functional static site generator written in Haskell.
It leverages Haskell's strong type system to provide compile-time guarantees
about site structure and content generation.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Haskell. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Ruby, Go, Java
* Any language other than Haskell

The **ONLY** non-Haskell code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* Pure functional design with no side effects in core logic
* Strong type system prevents runtime errors
* Composable content transformations with monads
* Lazy evaluation for efficient large site builds
* Pandoc integration for markdown processing

== Requirements

* GHC 9.0+
* Cabal or Stack
